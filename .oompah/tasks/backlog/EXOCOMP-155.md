## Summary

Plan: plans/mission-control.md, Fleet Status and Incidents.

Deliverables:
- Open health incidents after two consecutive degraded observations.
- Open immediately for stale/unreachable state and identity, authentication, audit, policy, or remediation failures.
- Open explicit cluster alerts and apply deterministic severity mapping.
- Auto-resolve health incidents after two consecutive healthy observations; reopen on new matching unhealthy evidence.

Acceptance:
- Table-driven reducer tests cover every rule, threshold boundary, interleaved target, duplicate observation, manual-resolution recurrence, and explicit resolve event.
- No model is used for opening, grouping, or resolving incidents.

Out of scope: operator acknowledgement and UI.
Quality gate: focused reducer tests plus make test, make fmt-check, and make lint.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define acceptance criteria.

Desired-state extension acceptance: reduce service and profile health into incidents. Use two observations for unhealthy/WARN transitions, immediate critical alerts for Ceph HEALTH_ERR, explicit coverage incidents, and desired_state_removed resolution without creating a false recovery observation.
