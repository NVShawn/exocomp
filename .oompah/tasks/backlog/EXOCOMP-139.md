## Summary

Plan: plans/mission-control.md, Connection and Delivery Protocol.

Deliverables:
- Add shared structs/codecs for schema-versioned cluster events, server commands, acknowledgements, session identifiers, event IDs, sequence numbers, timestamps, correlation IDs, and bounded payloads.
- Define the initial event and command kind allow-lists from the plan.
- Add valid JSON fixtures and table-driven invalid fixtures.

Acceptance:
- Valid fixtures round-trip without semantic loss.
- Unsupported schema versions, unknown kinds, missing IDs, invalid timestamps, and oversized payloads return bounded errors.
- Existing A2A types are reused rather than copied when they already express the domain.

Out of scope: sockets, persistence, event reduction, and command execution.
Quality gate: focused protocol tests plus make test, make fmt-check, and make lint.

## Acceptance Criteria
