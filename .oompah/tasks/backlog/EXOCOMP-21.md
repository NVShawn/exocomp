## Summary

Plan: [Milestone 3 design](https://github.com/NVShawn/exocomp/blob/main/plans/milestone-3-safety-validation.md)

Goal
Define action, evidence, risk, and data-classification types.

Implementation
Implement versioned types and JSON schemas for action definitions, proposals, evidence, validator results, risk ranks, reversibility, data classification, execution, and verification; reject unknown fields/versions where security-relevant; default unknown data to protected user data.

Testing
Add table/property tests for valid schemas, malformed values, unknown versions, missing evidence, risk ordering primitives, and every data-classification default.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All security-relevant inputs are bounded and schema-versioned.
- [ ] Unknown data is always classified as protected user data.
- [ ] User-data deletion is unrepresentable as an eligible action.
- [ ] Focused type/schema tests pass.

Quality Gate
Run the focused tests and all repository Make targets affected by this change.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define acceptance criteria.
