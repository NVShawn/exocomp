## Summary

Plan: plans/hierarchical-management-modes.md

Deliverable:
Write user-facing documentation for configuring, reviewing, troubleshooting, and safely rolling back hierarchical observe/manage policy.

Acceptance criteria:
- Explain all five scopes, precedence, the same-rank disagreement rule, and the implicit observe default with examples.
- Document administrator, operator, and viewer permissions for enabling or restricting manage mode.
- Describe lease duration, renewal, stale-policy behavior, and the status fields operators should inspect.
- Provide safe enablement, emergency restrict-to-observe, and rollback procedures.
- Document audit records and troubleshooting for rejected or unavailable actions.
- Link to the relevant Mission Control and node installation documentation without duplicating task tracking.

Tests:
- Run make check-links and make test-compliance.
- Verify every documented command and configuration key against the implemented interfaces.

Out of scope:
- Internal implementation design, which remains in the linked plan.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define acceptance criteria.
