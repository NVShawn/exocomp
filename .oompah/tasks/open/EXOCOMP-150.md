## Summary

Plan: plans/mission-control.md, Connection and Delivery Protocol.

Deliverables:
- Add a durable command outbox containing command ID, kind, issued_at, expires_at, organization, cluster, and validated payload.
- Deliver pending commands to whichever Mission Control replica owns the active cluster session.
- Mark commands acknowledged exactly once; expire undelivered commands without treating them as executed.

Acceptance:
- Tests cover offline cluster, reconnect, duplicate acknowledgement, expiration, replica ownership change, invalid command kind, and database rollback.
- Commands survive Mission Control process restart.

Out of scope: chat/proposal command business logic.
Quality gate: focused command-outbox tests plus make test, make fmt-check, and make lint.

## Acceptance Criteria
