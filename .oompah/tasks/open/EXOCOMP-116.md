Verification environment hint: the completed EXOCOMP-112 recovery proved the pinned Make gates work through the already-running Podman service. Create an empty ignored/temporary storage config, then run with CONTAINERS_STORAGE_CONF=<that-file>, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/home/shedwards/.oompah/tmp/<task>-runtime, DOCKER_HOST=, and CONTAINER_ENGINE='podman --remote --url unix:///run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock'. For make test, also pass _CONTAINER_USER_FLAG=--userns=keep-id. Remove the temporary config/runtime before committing. This passed fmt-check, lint, all 1,487 tests, both release builds, and smoke tests on EXOCOMP-112.
