## Summary

Implement the scopes that never landed or never ran: EXOCOMP-31 automatic already-failed service recovery, EXOCOMP-45 operator/PKI/policy guides, EXOCOMP-46 upgrade/rollback/backup/removal lifecycle and tests, EXOCOMP-47 clean-host release qualification, and EXOCOMP-66 deterministic node/coordinator archives and build identity manifests. Build on the recovered EXOCOMP-110 branch, satisfy the original acceptance criteria, and run all relevant Make targets.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Define acceptance criteria.

Verification environment hint: the completed EXOCOMP-112 recovery proved the pinned Make gates work through the already-running Podman service. Create an empty ignored/temporary storage config, then run with CONTAINERS_STORAGE_CONF=<that-file>, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/home/shedwards/.oompah/tmp/<task>-runtime, DOCKER_HOST=, and CONTAINER_ENGINE='podman --remote --url unix:///run/user/1000/podman/podman.sock'. For make test, also pass _CONTAINER_USER_FLAG=--userns=keep-id. Remove the temporary config/runtime before committing. This passed fmt-check, lint, all 1,487 tests, both release builds, and smoke tests on EXOCOMP-112.

Understanding: EXOCOMP-115 is an umbrella recovery task requesting implementation of five scopes previously marked Merged without actual delivery: EXOCOMP-31 (automatic already-failed service recovery), EXOCOMP-45 (operator/PKI/policy guides), EXOCOMP-46 (upgrade/rollback/backup/removal lifecycle and tests), EXOCOMP-47 (clean-host release qualification), and EXOCOMP-66 (deterministic node/coordinator archives and build identity manifests). My role is Duplicate Investigator: I will search for any existing task that already covers this same recovery scope before considering implementation.
